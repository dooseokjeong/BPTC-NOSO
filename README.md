# BPTC-NOSO
This repository is the official implementation of BPTC+NOSO: Backpropagation of errors based on temporal code with neurons that only spike once at the most.
BPTC is backpropagation of errors based on temporal code, which is mathematically rigorous given that no approximations of any gradient evaluations are used. When combined with neurons that spike once at the most (NOSOs), BPTC+NOSO highlights the following advantages of learning efficiency: (i) computational complexity for learning is independent of the input encoding length, and (ii) only few NOSOs are active during learning and inference periods, leading to large reduction in computational complexity.
